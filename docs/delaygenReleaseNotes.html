<P>Release 1.1.0

<dl>

<p><dt>Modified drvAsynDG645.cpp and drvDG645.db<br>
<dd><br>Removed race condition when there were multiple DG645 devices,
simplified the code a bit, and had driver use DrvInfo field.

<p><dt>Moved all Gigabuadics support files (digitalDelay.*) into
directories called "custom" for each directory where such a file was
found.<br>
<dd><br>This code was based on a custom hardware implementation of a
solution for using a specific Gigabaudics delay generator.  It is
highly unlikely that anyone has used this code, and if it was used, it
can be moved back into position from the "custom" directories.

BNC_505.opi<br>
colbyMain.opi<br>
delaygen.opi<br>
