<P>Release 1.2

<dl>
  <dt>DG645 support</dt>
  <dd>Reduced the overhead for its use by removing the database status
    checking with the device after every operation.  The status is
    checked at the driver level, and if it changes an interrupt will
    be generated instead to trigger reading by the database.  Removed
    the disable checking from all the database records.  Implemented
    delay tweaks using the hardware tweak functions instead of
    incrementing using calcs.</dd>
  <dt>devDG535daa.db</dt>
  <dd>Added alternate database support for the DG535, named
    devDG535daa.db, which uses the existing devDG535.c code. There is
    a parallel set of screens: devDG535daa.adl,
    devDG535Operationsdaa.adl, and devDG535Outputsdaa.adl.  This alternate 
    support is meant to be friendlier for frequent usage.</dd>
  <dt>Updated OPI, UI, and EDL screens</dt>
  <dd>Converted all the ADL files to the three other formats, and put them
    in each type's autoconvert directory.</dd>
  <dt>Updated example IOC directory</dt>
  <dd>The broken example IOC directory has been redone and tested (with a
    Linux IOC).</dd>
</dl>

<P>Release 1.1.1

<dl>
<p><dt>delaygenApp/src/Makefile
<dd>Publish individual .dbd files
<P><dt>delaygenApp/op/ui/*
<dd>fixed menus
</dl>

<P>Release 1.1.0

<dl>

<p><dt>Modified drvAsynDG645.cpp, drvDG645.db, and DG645 screens.<br>
<dd><br>Removed race condition when there were multiple DG645 devices,
simplified the code a bit, and had driver use DrvInfo field.  Added
new "Advanced Triggering" fields: mode enable/disable, prescale phases
and trigger holdoff.  Added a label for the device.  Redid the
screens, and removed the reference to the asyn record on the main
screen.  As the delay PV names were changed to make it simpler to open
the individual delay screens, the rest of the PV names were changed to
be consistent (where the first letter is now capitalized).

<p><dt>Moved all Gigabuadics support files (digitalDelay.*) into
file called "digitalDelay.tar.gz", in the "src" directory.<br>
<dd><br>This code was based on a custom hardware implementation of a
solution for using a specific Gigabaudics delay generator.  It is
highly unlikely that anyone has used this code, and if it was used, it
can be moved back into position by untarring the file in the root of
the module.

<p><dt>Modified OPI files:<br>
BNC_505.opi<br>
colbyMain.opi<br>
delaygen.opi<br>
devDG535.opi<br>
